Im working on a game thing for my cs20 class, you should not be able to read this. It's a complicated game. I want to test out github. Today is a good day. How has your evening been? mine has been fine. It is not the evening. I lied.

Uh. What do i put here? i dont even know how to download files from git half the time, i dont know this coder-lingo, i'm just making funny grandma game. Im just finding things from stackoverflow and frankensteining them together.
least im better than the chatgpt guys in class, this class is EASY to the point of making me give myself artificial challenge.
